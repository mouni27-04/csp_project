  <p>
    &emsp;It is a survey about the identification of students who choose Intermediate or Diploma in an area.
    For this survey, we selected Venkateswarapuram in Nellore District. We collected data on students' choices after SSC based on parameters like academic performance, interests, parental influence, and career aspirations.Education plays a key role during transitions in a student’s life. After SSC (10th grade), Indian students choose between Intermediate (Inter) or a Diploma course. This choice shapes their future academic and career paths.

  <p>
    &emsp;Intermediate spans two years with streams like MPC, BIPC, MEC, and CEC, preparing students for higher education. Diploma courses are three-year technical programs designed for early workforce entry or lateral engineering admissions.

  <p>
    &emsp;The choice between Inter and Diploma is influenced by academic performance, parental guidance, socio-economic status, peer pressure, awareness, and personal interests. Students often make uninformed decisions due to lack of guidance.This study explores the trends and motivations behind these choices, aiming to help schools and counselors offer better career guidance.
