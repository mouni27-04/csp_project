  <p><br>
    &emsp;The project is about how many students choose either Inter or Diploma after SSC in an area. The motive for selecting this project is that the choice between a diploma or intermediate (Inter) education after completing the Secondary School Certificate (SSC) is a crucial decision that impacts students' career paths.
    <br><br>
    This study aims to identify the factors influencing students' choices and develop a predictive model for decision-making. Data was collected from students through surveys, considering parameters such as Academic Performance, Interest, Parental Influence, and Career Aspirations.
    <br><br>
    The study also highlights the role of parental guidance and awareness about career opportunities. The proposed model can assist educational institutions in counseling students and guiding them toward a suitable academic path.
