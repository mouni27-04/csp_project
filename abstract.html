    &emsp;The project is about how many student's choose either Inter or Diploma after SSC in an area. The main motive for selecting this project is that the choice between a diploma or intermediate (Inter) education after completing the Secondary School Certificate (SSC) is a crucial decision that impacts student's career paths.
    This study aims to identify the factors influencing student's choices and develop a predictive model for decision-making. Data was collected from students through surveys, considering parameters such as Academic Performance,  Self Interest, Parental Influence, and Career Aspirations.
    The study also highlights the role of parental guidance and awareness about career opportunities. The proposed model can assist educational institutions in counseling students and guiding them toward a suitable academic path.
