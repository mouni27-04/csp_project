  <h1>CONCLUSION</h1>
  <p>
    &emsp;Choosing between Intermediate and Diploma after SSC is a crucial decision that has long-term implications on a studentâ€™s educational and career trajectory. Both paths offer valuable opportunities, but the right choice depends on individual interests, goals, academic abilities, and access to guidance.
  </p>
  <p>
    &emsp;While Intermediate focuses on academic preparation for higher education and professional courses, Diploma provides practical, skill-based training aimed at early career entry or technical specialization.

    &emsp;This study highlights the need for effective career counseling and increased awareness among students and parents to ensure informed decision-making. By understanding the factors that influence this choice, educators and policymakers can better support students in selecting the path that best suits their aspirations and potential.
